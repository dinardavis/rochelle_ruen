I went to\n                college, got married, got my master’s degree, bought a house, had\n                a kid, bought a second house. On paper my life was amazing. On the\n                inside, it was a totally different story. I realized I was so far\n                out of touch with who I was, and what I truly wanted, that I was\n                going to have to do some deep work.\n              </p>\n\n              <p className=\"mystory-text\">\n                I started learning about me, the real ME. Not the me I thought I\n                needed to be for anyone else. I started showing up fully and\n                without regrets. As my self-knowledge and self-trust grew so did\n                my confidence.\n              </p>\n\n              <div className=\"socials-container\">\n                <p>Connect On Social Media</p>\n                <div className=\"social-icons\">\n                  <a href=\"https://facebook.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\n                    <div className=\"social-icon-container\">\n                      <FaFacebookF className=\"social\" />\n                    </div>\n                  </a>\n                  <a\n                    href=\"https://www.instagram.com/rochelleruen/\"\n                    target=\"_blank\"\n                    rel=\"noreferrer\"\n                  >\n                    <div className=\"social-icon-container\">\n                      <BsInstagram className=\"social\" />\n                    </div>\n                  </a>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n          </div>\n\n          <img\n            className=\"mystory-hero\"\n            src={aboutMe}\n            alt=\"Rochelle in blue dress with mountains in the background\"\n          />\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"mystory-middle-content\">\n          <img\n            className=\"mystory-connecting-img\"\n            src={aboutMeConnecting}\n            alt=\"Rochelle in blue dress with mountains in the background\"\n          />\n          <div>\n          <p className=\"mystory-text\">\n              Being in a place where life on the inside feels\n              even better than it looks on the outside is something I want\n              everyone to know and experience.

I just hadn’t been able to connect the dots and see it\n            on the horizon. I have always loved to inspire and motivate\n            people. It is 100% my nature and it feeds my soul to lift others\n            up! Holding space for others to be truly seen and heard is my\n            gift. When we are together, there is no need for masks or ego. I\n            create a safe and authentic environment where can you truly be\n            yourself, allowing for genuine connection and meaningful growth.\n            When you work with me, you can explore your true self, free from\n            the pressures and expectations to be anything different.\n          </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"mystory-bottom-content\">\n            <div className=\"mystory-contact-img-container\">\n              <div className=\"mystory-img-copy-container\">\n                <p className=\"mystory-img-copy\">\n                Take another step closer to creating the life of your dreams\n                </p>\n\n                <p className=\"mystory-img-copy\">\n                Let’s get on the phone together and see if our vibes match!\n                </p>\n\n                <div className=\"mystory-contact-btn-container\">\n                  <p className=\"mystory-img-copy\">\n                    Click here to book a\n                  </p>\n                  <button className=\"mystory-contact-btn btn\">Free 20-minute chat</button>\n                </div>\n              </div>\n\n              <img\n                className=\"mystory-contact-img\"\n                src={palms}\n                alt=\"Palm trees with sunset in the background\"\n              />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n      </section>\n      </Layout>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n"],"names":["mystory","Layout","id","className","src","mainBackground","alt","href","target","rel","aboutMe","aboutMeConnecting","palms"],"sourceRoot":""}
